Toy Robot Simulator Test Cases
Overview
This document outlines a set of test cases designed to validate the functionality and robustness of the Toy Robot Simulator. These tests cover various scenarios, including valid movements, edge cases, and invalid commands.

Test Cases
Test Case 1: Valid Placement and Movement
Input:
PLACE 1,2,EAST
MOVE
MOVE
LEFT
MOVE
REPORT
Expected Output: 3,3,NORTH
Purpose: Tests basic placement, movement, and rotation.

Test Case 2: Invalid Placement
Input:
PLACE 5,5,NORTH
REPORT
Expected Output: Error message about invalid placement (since the grid is 0-4 in both dimensions).
Purpose: Ensures the application prevents placement outside the grid.


Test Case 3: Movement Prevented at Edge
Input:
PLACE 0,0,SOUTH
MOVE
REPORT
Expected Output: 0,0,SOUTH and potentially an error message indicating movement was prevented.
Purpose: Tests that the robot doesn't move off the grid.

Test Case 4: Ignoring Commands Before Valid PLACE
Input:
MOVE
LEFT
PLACE 0,0,NORTH
REPORT
Expected Output: 0,0,NORTH
Purpose: Verifies that commands before a valid PLACE are ignored.

Test Case 5: Sequential PLACE Commands
Input:
PLACE 0,0,NORTH
MOVE
PLACE 2,2,EAST
MOVE
REPORT
Expected Output: 3,2,EAST
Purpose: Checks that the robot can be re-placed on the grid and continues from the new position.

Test Case 6: Rotation Logic
Input:
PLACE 1,1,EAST
LEFT
LEFT
REPORT
Expected Output: 1,1,WEST
Purpose: Confirms correct rotation logic without changing position.


Test Case 7: Complex Movement Around the Grid
Input:
PLACE 1,2,NORTH
MOVE
RIGHT
MOVE
MOVE
LEFT
MOVE
REPORT
Expected Output: 3,4,NORTH
Purpose: Tests a combination of movements and rotations that take the robot around different parts of the grid.

Test Case 8: Exiting the Simulation
Input:
PLACE 0,0,NORTH
MOVE
EXIT
Expected Output: Simulation ends after the MOVE command, before or after displaying the result of MOVE.
Purpose: Ensures the EXIT command immediately ends the simulation.
